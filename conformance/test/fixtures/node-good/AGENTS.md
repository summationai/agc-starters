- **Business logic:** keep it in the app's code, not in database triggers. Use a trigger only for simple per-row bookkeeping, such as setting `updated_at`: a trigger hides behaviour from the code a reviewer reads, and agent.cloud's masked copies and migration checks handle triggers poorly.
- **Crashes:** a crash restarts the app in production and fails every request in flight; agent.cloud's review reports that as `restarts`. Keep each error where it belongs, and exit only on SIGTERM.
